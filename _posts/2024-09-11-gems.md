## Gem Haml

The `haml` gem is used to write HTML templates in Ruby on Rails projects with a cleaner and more readable syntax. It simplifies the structure of HTML by removing unnecessary closing tags and providing indentation-based nesting, making it more concise and easier to maintain. For example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

<!-- HAML -->
.container
  %h1 Hello, World!
  %p This is a paragraph.
```

To add the `haml` gem to your project, you can include the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "haml-rails"
```

After that, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Gem Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It includes CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

To add Bootstrap to your Rails project, include the following lines in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "bootstrap"
gem "sassc-rails"
```

After that, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Next, rename the `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` file extension to `.scss` and add the following line to import Bootstrap:

```scss
@import "bootstrap";
```

## Gem Image Processing

`image_processing` is a gem used to handle image transformations, such as resizing, cropping, and converting formats. It integrates well with Active Storage to process and manage image attachments in your Rails application. We use Active Storage to manage file attachments, and this setup allows you to easily handle image uploads and processing in your Rails application.

To use `image_processing` in your Rails project, uncomment the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "image_processing", "~> 1.2"
```

Then, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
bundle install
rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate
```

You can see an example usage below:

```ruby
# app/models/brand.rb
class Brand < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :logo
end
```

```haml
# app/views/brands/_form.html.haml
= form_with(model: @brand, local: true) do |form|
  = form.label :name
  = form.text_field :name

  = form.label :logo
  = form.file_field :logo

  = form.submit
```
