### Gem Devise

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden. It provides a range of features for user authentication, including registration, password recovery, and more.

1. **Add Devise to Your Gemfile:**

    ```ruby
    gem "devise"
    gem "omniauth"
    ```

2. **Install the Gem and Set Up Devise:**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    rails generate devise:install
    ```

3. **Generate User Model**

    ```bash
    rails generate devise User
    rails db:migrate
    ```

4. **Configure User Model with Devise Modules:**

    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
             :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable,
             :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable,
             :trackable, :omniauthable
    end
    ```

5. **Devise Modules Explained:**

    - **database_authenticatable:** Handles user authentication using credentials stored in the database.
    - **database_authenticatable:** Authenticates users using credentials stored in the database.
    - **registerable:** Allows users to sign up and manage their accounts.
    - **recoverable:** Enables users to reset their passwords if forgotten.
    - **rememberable:** Allows users to stay signed in across sessions.
    - **validatable:** Automatically validates the email format and password strength.
    - **confirmable:** Requires users to verify their email address before activation.
    - **lockable:** Locks accounts after multiple failed sign-in attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
    - **timeoutable:** Automatically logs users out after a period of inactivity.
    - **trackable:** Tracks sign-in count, timestamps, and IP addresses for users.
    - **omniauthable:** Enables third-party authentication via services like Google or Facebook.

### Email Confirmation (Confirmable)

The `confirmable` module allows users to verify their email addresses. After a user registers, they receive a confirmation email, and they need to click the link in this email to activate their account.

**Mailer Configuration:**

To enable sending confirmation emails, you need to configure the application's mailer.

In the development environment, add the following lines to your `config/environments/development.rb` file:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "localhost", port: 3000 }
```

As a starting point, we can use the `letter_opener` gem to view emails. It is used for testing email delivery in Rails applications. It simulates sending emails and displays them as viewable HTML files in the browser. This allows you to easily review the designs and contents of emails before sending real ones.

**Add the Gem to Your Gemfile:**

```ruby
gem "letter_opener"
```

```bash
bundle install
```

### View Section

For a quick setup of Devise views, you can generate the default views with:

```bash
rails generate devise:views
```

After generating the views, you can customize them as needed.

To test and view the changes, perform the following steps:


1. Update routes.rb:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      root "home#index"
      devise_for :users
    end
    ```

2. Create home_controller.rb:

    ```ruby
    class HomeController < ApplicationController
      def index
      end
    end
    ```

3. Create or update app/views/home/index.html.erb:

    ```haml
    %h1 Welcome to the Home Page!

    - if user_signed_in?
      %p Hello, 
      = current_user.email
      %br/
      = link_to 'Edit Profile', edit_user_registration_path, class: 'btn btn-primary'
      = link_to 'Log Out', destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete, class: 'btn btn-danger'
    - else
      = link_to 'Sign In', new_user_session_path, class: 'btn btn-primary'
      %br/
      = link_to 'Sign Up', new_user_registration_path, class: 'btn btn-success'
    ```
