### Gem Rolify and CanCanCan

***Rolify:*** A flexible gem for managing user roles in a Ruby on Rails application. It allows you to assign multiple roles to users and control permissions based on those roles.
***CanCanCan:*** A powerful authorization library that works with Rolify to define what users can or cannot do in your application. It provides a simple way to manage permissions for different roles.

Now, let's move on to the installation and setup steps for both gems.

#### **Add Gems to Your Gemfile**

```ruby
gem "rolify"
gem "cancancan"
```

#### **Install rolify and cancancan gems**

```bash
bundle install
rails g rolify Role User
rails g cancan:ability
```

#### **Define Roles and Abilities**

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  rolify
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/ability.rb
class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    return unless user.present?
    can :read, :all
    can :manage, :all if user.has_role?(:admin)
  end
end
```

#### **Assign Roles to Users**

You can assign roles to users in your Rails console:

```bash
rails console
user = User.find(1)
user.add_role :admin
```

#### **Example**

```ruby
- if current_user.has_role? :admin
  %p Welcome, Admin!
  = link_to 'Manage Users', admin_users_path
- elsif current_user.has_role? :editor
  %p Welcome, Editor! You can create and edit posts.
- else
  %p Welcome, Guest!
```
