## Gem Haml

The `haml` gem is used to write HTML templates in Ruby on Rails projects with a cleaner and more readable syntax. It simplifies the structure of HTML by removing unnecessary closing tags and providing indentation-based nesting, making it more concise and easier to maintain. For example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

<!-- HAML -->
.container
  %h1 Hello, World!
  %p This is a paragraph.
```

To add the `haml` gem to your project, you can include the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "haml-rails"
```

After that, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Gem Byebug

**Byebug** is a simple and effective debugging tool for Ruby on Rails applications. It allows you to pause the execution of your code and inspect variables, step through your code, and perform other debugging tasks interactively.

Open your `Gemfile` and add the following line:

```ruby
gem "byebug"
```

After that, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

To use Byebug, simply add the byebug keyword anywhere in your code where you want the execution to pause. For example:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    
    # Pause the code here and start a Byebug session
    byebug
    
    # Code after Byebug will not execute until you finish debugging
    render json: @product
  end
end
```

## Gem Image Processing

`image_processing` is a gem used to handle image transformations, such as resizing, cropping, and converting formats. It integrates well with Active Storage to process and manage image attachments in your Rails application. We use Active Storage to manage file attachments, and this setup allows you to easily handle image uploads and processing in your Rails application.

To use `image_processing` in your Rails project, uncomment the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "image_processing", "~> 1.2"
```

Then, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
bundle install
rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate
```

You can see an example usage below:

```ruby
# app/models/brand.rb
class Brand < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :logo
end
```

```haml
# app/views/brands/_form.html.haml
= form_with(model: @brand, local: true) do |form|
  = form.label :name
  = form.text_field :name

  = form.label :logo
  = form.file_field :logo

  = form.submit
```

## Gem Simple Form

**Simple Form** is a Rails gem that simplifies the creation of forms in your application. It provides a clean and powerful DSL for building forms that integrate seamlessly with Bootstrap, Foundation, or custom styling.

Add **Simple Form** to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "simple_form"
```

Install the gem by running:

```bash
bundle install
```

After installation, generate the Simple Form configuration file:

```bash
rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
```

Once Simple Form is installed, you can start using it to create forms. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use Simple Form in a view:

```ruby
<%= simple_form_for @product do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.input :description %>
  <%= f.input :price, label: "Product Price", placeholder: "Enter product price" %>
  <%= f.button :submit, "Save Product", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
```
