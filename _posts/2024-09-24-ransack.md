### Gem Ransack for Advanced Searching

***Ransack:*** A powerful and flexible gem that makes adding complex search functionality to your Ruby on Rails application easy. It allows users to search and sort data across multiple fields, with minimal setup and customization required.

Now, let's walk through the installation and usage of Ransack.

#### **Add Ransack to Your Gemfile**

```ruby
gem "ransack"
```

#### **Install the Ransack gem**

```bash
bundle install
```

#### **Basic Setup and Example**

In this example, we'll create a search form to filter users based on their email addresses, and display the results dynamically.

```haml
# roles/assign.html.haml
= search_form_for @q, url: assign_roles_path, method: :get, remote: true do |f|
  .form-group.d-flex.mb-4
    = f.text_field :email_cont, label: "Search by Email", class: 'form-control me-2', placeholder: 'Enter email to search', id: 'email-search'
    = f.submit 'Search', class: 'btn btn-primary'
```

```ruby
# roles_controller.rb
def assign
  @q = User.ransack(params[:q])
  @users = @q.result(distinct: true).includes(:roles)
end
```

```ruby
# user.rb
def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
  ["email"]
end
```
