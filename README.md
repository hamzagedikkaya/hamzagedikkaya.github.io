# Hello! 👋

I'm a developer in the process of improving my skills. 💻 Since June 2023, I've been working at a corporate company. In my free time, I share details of the projects I work on on my [GitHub.io](https://hamzagedikkaya.github.io) page. 🛠️

You can check out what I've been working on by visiting [here](https://hamzagedikkaya.github.io). 📂

If you'd like to see the repository for the project I'm currently working on, you can find it [here](https://github.com/hamzagedikkaya/E-Commerce-Project). 🚀

Thanks for your interest! 😊
